## ‚ö° Project Overview

The **Demoblaze Python Selenium  Project** focuses on automating the testing of the **Demoblaze** e-commerce web application. This project implements a **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern to handle browser automation using Selenium, while APIs are tested using Python's Requests library. It combines manual testing with automated scripts and provides a detailed test report using **Allure**.

The project tests crucial components of the Demoblaze website, including login functionality, product browsing, cart management, and order placement. Here's a breakdown of the project's goals:

- **Automate Web UI Testing** using Selenium.
- **Automate API Testing** to validate backend functionality.
- **Generate Reports** using Allure to provide detailed insights into test execution.
- **Use of POM** to create reusable and scalable test scripts.
- **Jenkins Integration** to automate continuous testing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies Used

This project leverages multiple tools and libraries for efficient test execution and reporting:

- **Python**: The core programming language used for writing the test scripts.
- **Selenium**: A browser automation tool that simulates user actions on the web application.
- **PyTest**: The testing framework used to run the test cases.
- **Allure**: A reporting tool that provides visually appealing and detailed reports of test results.
- **API Testing**: Using the **Requests** library for validating the API endpoints.
- **Jenkins**: For continuous integration, ensuring that tests are executed on every commit or scheduled run.

### Keywords:

- **Selenium**: Controls browser behavior and automates web interactions.
- **POM (Page Object Model)**: A design pattern that enhances code reusability and maintainability by abstracting web pages into classes.
- **PyTest Fixtures**: Used to handle app dependencies and manage states during testing.
- **Allure Severity**: Categorizes test cases based on their importance (e.g., BLOCKER, CRITICAL, etc.).
- **Implicit Wait**: Ensures the script waits for elements to load before executing further actions.

## üöß Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories:

1. **WEB Directory**:
   - Contains five subdirectories to organize different types of tests and components, including:
     - **Login Tests**: Automated tests for user login functionality.
     - **Product Tests**: Validation for adding products to the cart.
     - **Checkout Flow**: End-to-end tests for purchasing products.

2. **API Directory**:
   - Includes scripts for testing the Demoblaze APIs such as login, product retrieval, and order placement. These scripts use Python‚Äôs `requests` library to validate the communication between frontend and backend.

## üìù Features Tested in Demoblaze Website

The project automates several critical components of the **Demoblaze** application, each of which can be found in real-world e-commerce platforms:

1. **Login and Signup**: 
   - Users can log in to their accounts by providing valid credentials or sign up if they don't already have an account. The test validates successful logins and checks for error handling in case of incorrect credentials.

2. **Product Categories**:
   - Products are divided into three categories: **Phones**, **Laptops**, and **Monitors**. The test scripts validate that each category contains the appropriate products and allow users to view details and add products to the cart.

3. **Cart Management**:
   - The tests ensure users can add products to the cart, verify the total price, and remove items if needed.

4. **Order Placement**:
   - Automates the entire flow from logging in, adding products to the cart, filling in order details, and confirming the purchase.

5. **Miscellaneous**:
   - The scripts also test the **Contact**, **About**, and **Home** pages, ensuring the navigation and core functionality of the site are intact.

## üìä Testing and Reporting

### Running Tests

To run the tests locally, open **PyCharm** and navigate to the test directory. You can run tests using **PyTest** with the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

For reporting with **Allure**, run the following command to collect test results:

```bash
pytest --alluredir=/tmp/my_allure_results
```

After the tests are completed, you can generate a beautiful HTML report using:

```bash
allure serve /tmp/my_allure_results
```

### Sample Allure Report

Allure reports provide a comprehensive view of test results, showing which tests passed, failed, or were skipped. These reports also include additional details like screenshots of failed tests, severity labels (BLOCKER, CRITICAL, NORMAL, etc.), and even step-by-step logs for each test method.

## üí° Key Concepts and Features

Here are some essential concepts and features utilized in the project:

### 1. **Page Object Model (POM)**

POM is a design pattern that helps organize the structure of Selenium tests. It creates an object repository for storing all web elements, making the code more modular, reusable, and maintainable.

```python
class LoginPage:
    def __init__(self, driver):
        self.driver = driver
        self.username_field = "loginusername"
        self.password_field = "loginpassword"
        self.login_button = "login2"

    def login(self, username, password):
        self.driver.find_element_by_id(self.username_field).send_keys(username)
        self.driver.find_element_by_id(self.password_field).send_keys(password)
        self.driver.find_element_by_id(self.login_button).click()
```

### 2. **Selenium WebDriver**

Selenium WebDriver is used to automate user actions like clicking buttons, entering text, and validating the results. It controls the browser and simulates user interactions.

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

def test_login():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.get("https://www.demoblaze.com")
    
    driver.find_element(By.ID, "login2").click()
    driver.find_element(By.ID, "loginusername").send_keys("user1")
    driver.find_element(By.ID, "loginpassword").send_keys("pass123")
    driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//button[text()='Log in']").click()
    
    # Add assertions to verify login success
    assert driver.find_element(By.ID, "logout2").is_displayed()

    driver.quit()
```

### 3. **Allure for Reporting**

Allure helps generate detailed reports, providing insights into test execution results and trends. It categorizes tests based on their severity, includes step-by-step logs, and can even attach screenshots.

```bash
pytest --alluredir=/tmp/allure-results
allure serve /tmp/allure-results
```

### 4. **Jenkins for Continuous Testing**

Jenkins is integrated to trigger automated tests on every code commit, ensuring continuous testing throughout the development lifecycle.
